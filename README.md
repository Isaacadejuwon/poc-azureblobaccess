# poc-azureblobaccess

Focus for this project:
    This is a proof of concept to see if I can demonstrate the use of managed identity for applications hosted on dockers to access azure blob storage. 

* Azure Blob Storage
* Azure Managed Identity
* Azure Virtual Machine
* Linux operating system (Redhat)
* Docker

Current plan:
    -Create an Azure virtual Machine (Redhat)
    -Install Docker on the Virtual Machine
    -Install a webapp on the docker
